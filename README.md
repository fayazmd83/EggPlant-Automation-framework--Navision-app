# EggPlant-Automation-framework--Navision-app
This is a data driven EggPlant automation designed and implemented by myself.
I could not upload the complete structure of framework due to size limitation of files and also Github could not accept filenames with dot extensions for eg. if I try to upload "Navision.suite" it shows a message that hidden files cannot be uploaded.

So, here are the steps below to make your scripts work,
 1. Clone the repo into your local machine
 2. You will find 2 folders Images and Scripts
 3. Use a good text editor like Sublime and open each script to see the logic and create new scripts in your machine
    using eggPlant tool.
 4. Copy all images from the Image folder into your test suite folder, so that you can use the same images.
 5. Use the data file "navisiondata.txt" in "loggin_in" script and change the location path in the script (my script uses
    "D:\Users\mosherif\Documents\EggPlant\datafiles\navisiondata.txt" which you need to change)
 5. Use CSV "navisiondata.csv" in "log_results" and "enter_hours"scriptsand update the location in the script as you followed same 
    process  as above.
 6. Use "projectdata.txt" and update the script "project_details"
